# How to run the code

1. Go to `src/`

2. Run:

```bash
$ python2 main.py [data file] [output directory] [features]*
```

where `[data file]` is the path to the data file, `[output directory]` is the directory you would like to output results to, and `[features]*` is any number of "features". Supported features are `power_law` and `mcmc`. If you would like to enable all features, just use `all`.
