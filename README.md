# How to run the code

1. Go to `/TopSecret/src`

2. Run:

```bash
$ python2 main.py [data file] [output directory] [your name]
```

where `[data file]` is the path to the data file, `[output directory]` is the directory you would like to output results to, and `[your name]` is either `dan`, `chi`, or `jake` (you know who you are).
